The README is in progress for this project. Some hyperlinks to assist starting this:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html
https://github.com/bluelightspirit/connectfour/blob/main/note.TXT
The command pip -r install requirements.txt should work for most Linux and Mac. pip -r install requirements_windows.txt should work for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Python has to be installed before attempting these if on desktop.
Kivy should also work on mobile. However, this was not tested on mobile platforms yet.

## Compiling
This program uses solely Python and kvlang to compile.
